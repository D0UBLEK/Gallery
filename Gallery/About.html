        And, the various tranches of creative activity suchas painting, music, literature and dance.
            We can find our little happiness in the Gallery. We can feel the people's heart from their art.People can express their feeling by painting. We can feel every details at the emotional and love from their painting.
        And also the art from the street's wall. They're professional too.Beacuse, the youths can paint on them freely. This is just a freedom.
            The purpose of us for making this project is that to let you know more about art, painting and the feeling of the artist. A few people interested in painting in our country. So, this is the reason that we choose this topic as our project.
        The eight of us try to find the best art from the artist. Now, you can see the art collecting. You can have fun with them.</p>
